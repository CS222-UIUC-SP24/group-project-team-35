Requirements for Discord bot to work: 
FFMPeg library. I put ffmpeg.exe in the folder and that fixed it i guess. Needs ffmpeg.exe to be in the same directory as main
pip install:
discord.py
ffmpeg (different from FFMPeg library)
PyNaCL
youtube-search
yt_dlp


Jack: Idk how a requirements.txt would work on a non venv (maybe it just works the same way it would on a venv, but I haven't tried it nor do I want to break my already broken Python Path so I'll just list what im using until I can make one):

pip install 
spotipy
pandas
async.io
